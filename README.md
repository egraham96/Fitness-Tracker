# Homework Assignment 18-Workout Tracker

## Description:
This week's homework required us to build the back end for a workout tracker application with an existing front end. The finished back end was to include a MongoDB database with a Mongoose schema and routes handled by Express.js. This application allows users to view, create and track daily workouts. Users can also log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. Finally, users are also able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise.
